# License

The [license](./LICENSE) for all of our original work is `LicenseRef-VPL WITH AGPL-3.0-only`. This includes every asset in this repository: code, documentation, images, branding, and more. You are licensed to use all of it so long as you maintain _maximum possible virality_ and our copyleft licenses.

Permissive open source licenses are tools for the corporate subversion of libre software; visible source licenses are an even more malignant scourge. All original works in this project are to be licensed under the most aggressive, virulently-contagious copyleft terms possible. To that end everything is licensed under the [Viral Public License](./licenses/LicenseRef-VPL) coupled with the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](./licenses/AGPL-3.0-only) for use in the event that some unaligned party attempts to weasel their way out of copyleft protections. In short: if you use or modify anything in this project for any reason, your project must be licensed under these same terms.

For art assets specifically, in case you want to further split hairs or attempt to weasel out of this virality, we explicitly license those under the viral and copyleft [Free Art License 1.3](./licenses/FreeArtLicense-1.3).
